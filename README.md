<ins>My process</ins> :

Built with :

CSS custom properties
CSS Flex box
CSS Media queries
CSS Font-face rules

<ins>What I learned</ins> : 
 
For my fifth, I have nothing interesting to add, just a little challenge to consolidate my knowledge on flexbox/responsive web design.
If you want to learn how to make responsive layouts, it's a good challenge to start with!

  
<ins>Continued develoment</ins>:

As I said, it was just a quick challenge to test my knowledge of css codes, in my next project I will introduce new things like BEM, maybe I will use a framwork (I don't know yet) and other little things.

<ins>Useful ressources</ins>:

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ : A complete guide on Flexbox, what are the property for both parent and child component, very handy and useful to understand this aspect of CSS.

https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries : If you want to understand how to use media queries, this is a good resource to check out!
